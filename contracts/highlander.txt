Match Making
- Do we want real-time matches? Means both player must be active?
- Do we pool active players who are interested to battle and then randomize a match? 
- Which means nft will be locked before actual battle
- Phases: Listed, Matched, 
- Actions: List, Unlist
- Once matched, Auto transfer NFT to battle contract
- UI must update to notify player

Battle
- Generate BattleId
- Finalize rounds? 
- Finalize delays on different Phases
- Phases: Battle Start, Roll Stats, Calculate Winner, Battle Completed

- Roll Stats: Get random attack and defense, add it with NFT attributes.
    - Create table for attack / defense name based on total attac/defense.
    - ex: 
        Attack Value 20 = Burning Sword Attack
        Attack Value 21 = Super Burning Sword Attack
        Attack Value 22 = Super Duper Burning Sword Attack

        Defense Value 20 = Hard D!
        Defense Value 21 = Harder D!
    - We can have icons for each attack.
    - Display icons on each side. 

- Calculate Winner

- Battle Completed: Losing NFT gets burned or sent to cemetery contract for revival with fee
